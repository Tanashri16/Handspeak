# Handspeak
HandSpeak is a real-time Sign Language Recognition System that uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect hand gestures via webcam. It extracts hand landmarks (finger positions) to help recognize and interpret sign language into text. The project aims to improve communication for hearing-impaired people using computer vision.
